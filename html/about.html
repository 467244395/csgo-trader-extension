        <h2>Roadmap</h2>
        <p>My ultimate goal is replacing Steam Inventory Helper entirely for my needs, but priority for now is on features that SIH lacks. What I work on at a given time is pretty chaotic, but you can check my
            <a href="https://github.com/bladegery/csgo-trader-extension/blob/master/TODO" target="_blank">TODO</a> file where I keep track of my plans. There is no guarantee on anything though.
            I might scratch something off the list entirely while adding 10 different things. There could be features that never see the light of day, while others could be in the next release.
            My aim is publishing a new version every weekend.
