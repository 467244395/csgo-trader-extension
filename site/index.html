<h1>CSGO Trader - Steam Trading Enhancer Extension</h1>
<p>Hi, unfortunately the extension is not available at the Chrome Webstore.
    It's mostly Google's fault. I wrote this up to inform my users.
    I was not able to publish new updates for over a month (I had big new features ready like fade percentage checking and pricing), but it's been stuck in the status of "pending review" and Google's Dev support has been no help.
    Out of desperation I foolishly clicked "unpublish", which made it disappear from the Chrome Webstore and it turns out you can't re-publish while it's under "pending review" status...
    The last version that was available out there was 1.14.2, I have released 1.15 (which added fade percentage checking to inventories) and 1.16 (which added pricing information).
    This move definitely made me prioritize porting my extension to Firefox and other browsers.
    When it's (hopefully soon) back, it should be available where it used to in the <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/csgo-trader/kaibcgikagnkfgjnibflebpldakfhfih" target="_blank">Chrome Webstore</a>.
</p>
<p>
    For now you have install it manually. I will write up a more detailed and illustrated version of this guide, but I am on vacation so I have limited time:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Grab the Source code (zip) of the latest version from the <a href="https://github.com/bladegery/csgo-trader-extension/releases" target="_blank">Github Releases</a>
    </li>
    <li>
        Unzip it to a location you can find easily.
    </li>
    <li>
        Open <a href="chrome://extensions/" target="_blank">chrome://extensions/</a>.
    </li>
    <li>
        Turn on Developer mode on the top right.
    </li>
    <li>
        Click "Load Unpacked".
    </li>
    <li>
        Select the folder that has "manifest.json" right inside it.
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    The Extension should now install and you can use it the same way if you have installed it from the Webstore.
    Unfortunately you won't get extension updates this way so if you find it useful please check back here.
</p>
