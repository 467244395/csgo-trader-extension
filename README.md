CSGO Trader Chrome Extension
==============

This is a chrome extension designed to help with CS:GO trading.
The features I develop will be complementary to Steam Inventory Helper for now.

Current Features:
--------------
- Adds an "Inspect on CS.DEALS..." button beside the default inspect button in inventories
- Shows when an item's tradelock will expire in the browser's timezone
- Shows a countdown that counts down to the date when the items will become tradable

Feel free to contribute (even with ideas)
