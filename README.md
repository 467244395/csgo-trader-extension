CSGO Trader Chrome Extension
==============

This is a chrome extension designed to help with CS:GO trading.
The features I develop will be complementary to Steam Inventory Helper for now.

Current Features:
--------------
- Adds an "Inspect in Browser..." button beside the default inspect button
- Shows when an item's tradelock will expire and adds a countdown
- Shows Doppler knives' phases
- Shows exterior on each item and adds links to other version to inventory and market pages
- NSFW filter mode to avoid showing anime boobs to your colleagues
- Bookmark and notify when item is tradable
- Shows floats in inventories
- Real chat status on profiles
- Other small automations, conveniences

Feel free to contribute (even with ideas)

You can now install it from the <a target="_blank" href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/csgo-trader/kaibcgikagnkfgjnibflebpldakfhfih/">Chrome Web Store</a>.
