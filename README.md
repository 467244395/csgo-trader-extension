CSGO Trader Chrome Extension
==============

This is a chrome extension designed to help with CS:GO trading.
The features I develop will be complementary to Steam Inventory Helper for now.

Current Features:
--------------
- Adds an "Inspect on CS.DEALS..." button beside the default inspect button in inventories and trade offers
- Shows when an item's tradelock will expire in the browser's timezone
- Shows a countdown that counts down to the date when the items will become tradable
- Puts a small indicator to each item in the inventory of when they will become tradable

Feel free to contribute (even with ideas)

You can now install it from the <a target="_blank" href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/csgo-trader/kaibcgikagnkfgjnibflebpldakfhfih/">Chrome Web Store</a>.
