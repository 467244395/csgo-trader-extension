CSGO Trader Chrome Extension
==============

This is a browser extension designed to help with CS:GO trading.
I started developing complementary features to Steam Inventory Helper, but it does most of them and more now.

Current Features:
--------------
- Adds pricing info to inventories and tradeoffers along with totals
- Adds an "Inspect in Browser..." button beside the default inspect button
- Shows when an item's tradelock will expire and adds a countdown
- Shows Doppler knives' phases
- Shows exterior on each item and adds links to other version to inventory and market pages
- NSFW filter mode to avoid showing anime boobs to your colleagues
- Bookmark and notify when item is tradable
- Shows floats in inventories (for stickers as well) and on market
- Real chat status on profiles
- Colorful inventories
- Scammers are market on their profile and in trade offers (if they are SteamRep banned)
- CSGOLounge.com auto-bumping
- CSGOTraders.net auto-bumping
- Other small automations, conveniences

Feel free to contribute (with code, graphics, translations or even with ideas)
